/*
 FFT to calculate DFT of polynom A
 We want to achive the following operation in O(nlogn) time
 Evaluation 
 Addition
 Multiplication

 Polynom can be represented by his: coeffs, roots, samples, here we will focus on
 coeffs and samples representation.
 with FFT, polynom that represented with his coeffs can be converted to samples representation and vice versa in O(nlogn)
